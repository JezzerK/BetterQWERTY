# BetterQWERTY

## What it does
Swaps the semicolon (;) key and the P key in the QWERTY keyboard.

## Why?
I HATE the STUPID semicolon key in QWERTY! It doesn't make any sense for it to be RIGHT OVER your PINKY when you NEVER USE it (or at least use it A LOT less than the LETTER P)[^1]

## How do I install it? 
If you're on Mac, you have two options: karabiner or the .keylayout file

The .keylayout file is easier to install but only swaps "**P**" and "**;**". 

The karabiner version swaps "**P**" and "**;**" AS WELL AS "**caps lock**" and "**delete**".

Both versions will improve your overall typing speed. For indivivual instructions, see either in the macOS file. 

If you're on windows, go to windows/autohotkey and follow the readme there for instructions.

[^1]: OBVIOUSLY if you're coding in Java then this may not apply. But, NEWSFLASH, the majority of the FREAKING WORLD POPULATION that has TOUCHED A KEYBOARD are NOT Java developers.
