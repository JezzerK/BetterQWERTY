# Windows Version

For this you need AutoHotKey.

"P" is swapped with ";" and "Caps Lock" is swapped with "Back Space"

## Installation guide 

1. Download AutoHotKey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download "BetterQWERTY.ahk" from this repository or just clone this repository
3. Run "BetterQWERTY.ahk"

BetterQWERTY.ahk needs to be running in the background via AutoHotkey for it to work. It consumes virtually no resources. When you restart your computer, it will (by default) not come on automatically. To schedule it to open on startup: 

1. Copy BetterQWERTY.ahk
2. Navagate to 'C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs'
3. Paste BetterQWERTY.ahk in

Alternatively, you may use the Windows ["Task Scheduler"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page) feature.
