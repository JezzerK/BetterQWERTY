# Windows Version

For this you need AutoHotKey.

"P" is swapped with ";" and "Caps Lock" is swapped with "Back Space"

## Installation guide 

1. Download AutoHotKey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download "BetterQWERTY.ahk" from this repository or just clone this repository
3. Run "BetterQWERTY.ahk"

Unfortunately it will only work while AutoHotKey is running. Make sure it is always running in the background and it will work.
